/**
 * Scopes this MFE's stylesheet to `.care-token-display-fe-container` so it can
 * be injected into the care_fe host document without touching host styles.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A POST-PROCESSING PASS AND NOT `@import` NESTING
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious approach is to nest the import in the CSS source:
 *
 *     .care-token-display-fe-container { @import "tailwindcss"; ... }
 *
 * Tailwind prefixes every selector it generates with the parent, which is
 * correct for utilities and preflight but *silently fatal* for the theme layer.
 * `tailwindcss/index.css` declares the default palette inside `@theme default`,
 * which compiles to `:root, :host`. Prefixing turns that into:
 *
 *     .care-token-display-fe-container :root,
 *     .care-token-display-fe-container :host { --color-white:#fff; ... }
 *
 * `:root` *is* `<html>`, so a descendant combinator asks for an `<html>` nested
 * inside a `<div>` — that matches zero elements in any document, forever.
 * `:host` only matches inside a shadow root, so it matches zero too. Every one
 * of the ~147 base theme variables is therefore dead, `--card: var(--color-white)`
 * resolves to nothing, becomes invalid at computed-value time, and the component
 * renders with no background. Tailwind exposes no knob to retarget the `:root`
 * that `@theme` emits, so the rewrite has to happen after generation.
 *
 * THE TWO RULES
 * -------------
 *   1. `:root` / `:host`  ->  REPLACED by the container class (not prefixed).
 *      This lands the full palette and every careui semantic token *on* the
 *      plugin's root element, where they inherit down through the subtree.
 *   2. Every other selector  ->  PREFIXED with the container class, which is
 *      what the nested-import approach already did correctly.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE
 * -------------------------------
 * `@keyframes` / `@property` / `@font-face` children are not selectors —
 * their "selectors" are keyframe offsets (`from`, `50%`) or nothing at all.
 * Prefixing them produces invalid CSS that browsers drop silently. `@property`
 * in particular registers globally *by name*; it is intentionally shared with
 * the host (both repos are on Tailwind v4, so the `--tw-*` registrations are
 * byte-identical and idempotent).
 */

/**
 * At-rules whose children are not selectors and must pass through untouched.
 *
 * `@layer` is deliberately NOT in this set: Tailwind emits every rule inside
 * `@layer theme/base/utilities`, so treating it as opaque skips the entire
 * stylesheet. Bare `@layer a, b;` statements have no child rules, so
 * `walkRules` never descends into them anyway.

 * Matches the document-root selectors as whole tokens.
 *
 * `html` and `body` are included alongside `:root` / `:host` because Tailwind's
 * preflight styles them directly (`html, :host { line-height … }`). Prefixing
 * would produce `.container html`, which matches nothing; leaving them bare
 * would restyle the care_fe host document. Collapsing them onto the container
 * keeps preflight's intent inside the plugin boundary.
